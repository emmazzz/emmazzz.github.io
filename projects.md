### DIGIT RECOGNITION WITH FPGA ACCELERATION([poster here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PsABjNmpiWUslj6-VCdsam89Ny823Chd2HQS2GHKUTA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"})
* Implement fully connected neural network and LeNet in C, high-level synthesized onto FPGA for acceleration
* 7x speedup on layers mapped to hardware

### COMPILER FOR C0
* Design and implement a compilerfor C0, a C-like language with control flow, O2 optimization and LLVM retargetting
* Implement register allocation, function inlining, graph search coloring, tail recursion conversion
* Coded in LLVM assembly, Intel x86-64 assembly and OCaml

### GRAPHICS KIT
* Implement SVG Renderer, Mesh Editor,Path Tracer and Animation Generator
* Use theory of Russian Roulette sampling, Lagrangian kinetics and coded in C++
